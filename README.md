### Objective

The assignment is to set up hosting for the included index.html file (hereafter named ‚Äòapplication‚Äô) using Terraform. The time limit for this task is **2.5 hours**!

### Brief

The TeleClinic engineering teams have just finished developing a static application and need it to be deployed for end users to access it. Your help was requested to take care of the infrastructure side of things.

TeleClinic knows the application will be immensely popular but asked that before it be made publically available, it should only be accessible internally to make sure it meets internal quality standards.

### Tasks

- Implement Terraform to create required infrastructure on AWS or Hetzner
- Use Terraform to ‚Äúdeploy‚Äù the index.html file on the newly created infrastructure
- Ensure the index.html file can only be accessed from the following IPs: `<your IP>, 18.158.69.72`

### Deliverables

Make sure to deliver all source code.
Please provide as much documentation as possible (why you chose a particular stack and how to deploy it).
Ensure that your Terraform code can be cleanly executed to create the infrastructure required to ‚Äòdeploy‚Äô the application.

### Evaluation criteria

- Terraform best practices
- Choice of stack / infrastructure
- Completeness: did you implement all the required features within the given timeframe?
- Correctness: does your answer provide a sensible, thought-out solution?
- Maintainability: is your code written in a clean, maintainable way?

### Summary

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production.
Track your work. You‚Äôre not Mozart, so we expect more than one commit! 
We‚Äôre curious to see how you approach this problem and if you‚Äôd be a good fit with how we work here at TeleClinic üôÇ


All the best and happy coding,
The TeleClinic Team
